# Get-Fit
A fitness tracking app which tracks workouts and corrects posture by processing data collected from device based on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Rationale
Given the rise of home workouts, trainers are no longer present to constantly correct posture or monitor workout. This can lead to avoidable yet extremely dangerous injuries

## Technologied used
* [Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)
* [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
* [p5.ble.js](https://itpnyu.github.io/p5ble-website/)
* Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Components
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2
* Laptop or phone with Google Chrome installed
* Micro USB cable
* LiPo Battery (3.7 V)
* Enclosure

## Project Guide
* [Install Arduino IDE](https://wiki-content.arduino.cc/en/software) 
* [Set up the Arduino Nano BLE Rev2 board](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense-rev2)   (The Rev2 board is cutting edge with new and often incomplete firmware and dependencies. You might have to hunt for and install some packages on your own)
* [Download and set up Edge Impulse]()
